## 37i Gallery Proxy

This is a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) app that runs on [Heroku](http://heroku.com). It modifies and serves content from a static archive of a [Gallery2](http://galleryproject.org/) site that lives in an [S3 bucket](http://aws.amazon.com/).

Bit of a clusterfuck, but it does the job.
